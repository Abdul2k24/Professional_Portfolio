# Professional_Portfolio
To make my first professional Portfolio 
I first created a new repo with the titile Professional_Portfolio
I than added an index. html file and a style.CSS as well as an Assets folder and to contain my CSS and images

I than started with my HTML file and created my header with my name and a few links to direct to some on the main content in my portfolio
In order to style my header I chose to go with a Time New Roman font and a grey background.
#
.header {
    padding: 20px;
    font-family: "Times New Roman";
    background-color: gray;
    color: #070101;
}

I created a header tag that would contain my name and hero for my avatar and links to my work and how to contact me
header class="header">
        <h1>Mohamed</h1>
        <div>
        <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="#about me">About me</u>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#Projects">Projects</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#Contact me">Contact me</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#Resume">Resume</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </header>

    I than moved on to my work on my about me section. 
    And below that I added my Prjoects section with url image of some of the things weve leaerned in the first 2 weeks of class.
    I still dont have any work or projects to add at the moment, but I cant wait to update this section in the coming weeks.

    At the buttom of my html page I added my Github link to view all my main repos in the class.
